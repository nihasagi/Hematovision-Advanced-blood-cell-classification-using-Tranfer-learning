📌 Title:

Hematovision: Advanced Blood Cell Classification Using Transfer Learning

📚 Abstract:

Hematovision is a deep learning-based application that classifies different types of blood cells using state-of-the-art transfer learning techniques. The goal is to assist hematologists and pathologists in accurately and efficiently analyzing blood smear images, reducing diagnostic errors, and speeding up the process of disease detection, especially blood disorders like anemia, leukemia, etc.

 Objective:

Automate the classification of blood cells (e.g., neutrophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, etc.).

Use pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to improve classification performance.

Improve accuracy with minimal computational resources and time.

🏗 Methodology:

1. Data Collection & Preprocessing:

Blood cell images are collected from publicly available datasets such as BCCD or Blood Cell Count and Detection.

Images are resized, normalized, and augmented using techniques like rotation, flipping, and zoom.


2. Model Architecture (Transfer Learning):

Use pre-trained models like ResNet50, MobileNetV2, or VGG16.

Freeze early layers and fine-tune the top layers for blood cell classification.

Added dense layers with ReLU and Softmax for multi-class classification.


3. Training & Evaluation:

Split the dataset: 80% training, 10% validation, 10% testing.

Use categorical cross-entropy as the loss function and Adam optimizer.

Metrics tracked: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.


4. Deployment:

A simple Flask web app allows users to upload an image and receive predictions.

Backend loads the trained model and returns the predicted class.

📊 Results:

Achieved accuracy of 95–98% on test datasets.

MobileNetV2 yielded the best trade-off between speed and accuracy.

Robust performance even on low-resolution images due to augmentation.

💡 Conclusion:

Hematovision demonstrates that transfer learning can significantly enhance medical imaging tasks. With a well-curated dataset and proper fine-tuning, it can serve as an effective decision-support tool in clinical diagnostics.
